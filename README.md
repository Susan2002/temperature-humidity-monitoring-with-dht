## Overview of Project  
This project involves interfacing a DHT22 sensor with an Arduino to measure temperature and humidity. The readings are displayed on the serial monitor every 5 seconds. The project was simulated using Wowki.

## Objective : 

The objective of this project is to monitor environmental conditions by measuring temperature and humidity levels using the DHT22 sensor. The project aims to provide a reliable and efficient way to collect and display these readings in real-time.

## Key Activities

- **Sensor Integration**:
  - Connected the DHT22 sensor to an Arduino to capture temperature and humidity data.
  
- **Data Acquisition**:
  - Configured the Arduino to send the sensor readings to the serial monitor for real-time monitoring.
  
- **Simulation**:
  - Conducted a simulation of the system using Wowki to test and validate the functionality of the sensor and code.

## Technologies Used

- **Simulation Software**: Wowki
- **Programming Language**: Arduino C/C++
- **Hardware (Simulated)**:
  - Arduino Uno
  - DHT22 Sensor
  
- **Simulation**:
